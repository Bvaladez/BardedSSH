## Barded SSH
Barded SSH is a remote machine management application that is performant, simple,
and driven by a GUI. Although the application is completely composed of a GUI it runs like you
are operating on a command line. The application sources all work of any magnitude through
individual threads, makes minimal network calls, and requires almost no data to be stored or
fetched from the device itself.
